Order By Clause :
    .................
        To sort in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC)

        SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name
        ORDER BY col_name(s) ASC;

        Example :
                SELECT * FROM Student
                ORDER BY st_name DESC;

    
    Use LIMIT :
    ...........
                SELECT * FROM Student
                ORDER BY marks DESC
                LIMIT 3;

    Use OFFSET :
    ............
                SELECT * FROM Student
                ORDER BY marks DESC
                LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;  -- 3rd highest

Ah! You now want examples and syntax for SQL keywords like AS, ON, and other similar SQL clauses (used in joins, aliases, grouping, etc.) â€” not just logical operators like IN or OR.

Hereâ€™s a full list of such keywords with syntax and one-line examples:

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 1. AS â€“ Alias for column or table

Syntax:

SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

Example:

SELECT name AS student_name FROM Students;

Table Alias Example:

SELECT s.name FROM Students AS s;


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 2. ON â€“ Join condition

Syntax:

SELECT * FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.id = table2.id;

Example:

SELECT * FROM Students s
JOIN Library l ON s.id = l.st_id;


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 3. USING â€“ Join on a common column

Syntax:

SELECT * FROM table1
JOIN table2 USING (common_column);

Example:

SELECT * FROM Students JOIN Library USING (id);


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 4. GROUP BY â€“ Group rows by column

Syntax:

SELECT column, COUNT(*) FROM table
GROUP BY column;

Example:

SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM Students GROUP BY city;


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 5. ORDER BY â€“ Sort result

Syntax:

SELECT * FROM table
ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC];

Example:

SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY name ASC;


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 6. HAVING â€“ Filter groups (after GROUP BY)

Syntax:

SELECT column, COUNT(*) FROM table
GROUP BY column
HAVING COUNT(*) > value;

Example:

SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM Students GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 7. DISTINCT â€“ Remove duplicates

Syntax:

SELECT DISTINCT column FROM table;

Example:

SELECT DISTINCT city FROM Students;


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 8. LIMIT â€“ Restrict result count

Syntax:

SELECT * FROM table
LIMIT number;

Example:

SELECT * FROM Students LIMIT 5;


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 9. OFFSET â€“ Skip rows before starting return

Syntax:

SELECT * FROM table
LIMIT n OFFSET m;

Example:

SELECT * FROM Students LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 10. UNION â€“ Combine results from two SELECTs

Syntax:

SELECT column FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column FROM table2;

Example:

SELECT city FROM Students
UNION
SELECT city FROM Teachers;
