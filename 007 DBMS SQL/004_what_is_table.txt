What is Table in SQL :
......................

In SQL (Structured Query Language), a table is a structured collection of data organized in rows and columns. It is the basic unit of data storage in relational databases.

ðŸ”¹ Structure of a Table:

Column1	Column2	Column3
Row1	Row1	Row1
Row2	Row2	Row2
Row3	Row3	Row3


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Key Terms:
	â€¢	Table Name: The identifier used to reference the table (e.g., students, orders).
	â€¢	Column: A field/attribute of the table (e.g., name, age, email).
	â€¢	Row: A single record/entry in the table.

ðŸ”¹ Example Table: students

student_id	name	age	course
1	Anjali	21	B.Sc
2	Rohit	22	B.Tech
3	Sneha	20	B.Com

ðŸ”¹ SQL to Create a Table:

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50)
);


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ SQL to Insert Data:

INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, course)
VALUES (1, 'Anjali', 21, 'B.Sc');

// when order is maintain with create table
INSERT INTO students
VALUES (1, 'Anjali', 21, 'B.Sc');

ðŸ”¹ SQL to Retrieve Data:

SELECT * FROM students;

âœ… Summary:
	â€¢	A table stores data in a structured format.
	â€¢	Each row is a record.
	â€¢	Each column represents an attribute of the record.




What is columan, row and schema :
.................................
Great question! Letâ€™s break down the concepts of row, column, and schema in the context of SQL and relational databases:

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ What is a Column?
	â€¢	A column represents a field or attribute of a table.
	â€¢	Each column has a name and a data type.
	â€¢	All values in a column are of the same type (e.g., integers, strings, dates).

âœ… Example:

In a students table:

CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);

	â€¢	id, name, and age are columns.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ What is a Row?
	â€¢	A row represents a single record or entry in a table.
	â€¢	Each row contains one value for each column.
	â€¢	Rows are also known as tuples.

âœ… Example:

This is one row in the students table:

| 1 | Anjali | 21 |


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ What is a Schema?
	â€¢	A schema is the blueprint or structure of a database.
	â€¢	It defines how data is organized: tables, columns, data types, relationships, constraints, etc.
	â€¢	In some databases, a schema can also be a named container for tables.

âœ… Schema Includes:
	â€¢	Table names
	â€¢	Column names and types
	â€¢	Primary and foreign keys
	â€¢	Indexes, views, and stored procedures

ðŸ§  Quick Analogy:

Think of a database like a school:
	â€¢	The schema is the timetable and rules of the school.
	â€¢	The table is like a classroom.
	â€¢	The columns are like subject names written on the blackboard.
	â€¢	Each row is like a student sitting in the classroom with their own info for each subject.

ðŸ“Œ Summary Table:

Term	Meaning
Column	A field or attribute in the table
Row	A single data record (tuple)
Schema	Structure or design of the database/table
