Hereâ€™s your SQL Data Types note with the ranges added for each relevant data type (especially numeric and date types). This makes it a more complete and practical reference.

ðŸ“˜ SQL Data Types (with Ranges)

SQL data types define the kind of value a column can hold. Ranges may vary slightly between databases, but standard/common ones are listed below.

â¸»

ðŸ”¢ Numeric Data Types

Data Type					Description	Typical 					Range (MySQL)
TINYINT						Very small integer				-128 to 127 (signed) or 0 to 255 (unsigned)
SMALLINT					Small integer					-32,768 to 32,767 or 0 to 65,535
MEDIUMINT					Medium-sized integer (MySQL)	-8,388,608 to 8,388,607
INT / INTEGER				Standard integer				-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or 0 to 4,294,967,295
BIGINT						Large integer					-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
DECIMAL(p,s) / NUMERIC(p,s)	Exact numeric with precision	Up to 65 digits, p = precision, s = scale (MySQL)
FLOAT(p)					Approximate floating-point number	4 bytes, approx. Â±1.5eâˆ’45 to Â±3.4e+38 (float precision)
REAL	Approximate, lower precision float	Similar to FLOAT
DOUBLE PRECISION / DOUBLE	Higher precision float	8 bytes, approx. Â±5.0eâˆ’324 to Â±1.7e+308

ðŸ”¤ String (Character) Data Types

Data Type					Description				Max Length
CHAR(n)						Fixed-length string		Up to 255 characters
VARCHAR(n)					Variable-length string	Up to 65,535 bytes (depends on charset & row size)
TEXT						Large text				Up to 65,535 characters
TINYTEXT					Very small text			Up to 255 characters
MEDIUMTEXT					Medium-sized text		Up to 16,777,215 characters
LONGTEXT					Very large text			Up to 4,294,967,295 characters

ðŸ“… Date & Time Data Types

Data Type				Description						Range
DATE					Stores date (YYYY-MM-DD)		1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31
TIME					Stores time (HH:MM:SS)			-838:59:59 to 838:59:59
DATETIME				Date and time					1000-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59
TIMESTAMP				Date and time (auto-update)		1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC to 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC
YEAR					Year (2-digit/4-digit)			1901 to 2155 (MySQL)

ðŸ§® Boolean Type

Data Type	Description	Range / Notes
BOOLEAN / BOOL	Stores TRUE or FALSE	Alias for TINYINT(1) in MySQL (0 = false, 1 = true)


â¸»

ðŸ“¦ Binary Data Types

Data Type					Description					Max Size
BINARY(n)					Fixed-length binary			Up to 255 bytes
VARBINARY(n)				Variable-length binary		Up to 65,535 bytes
BLOB						Binary Large Object			Up to 65,535 bytes
TINYBLOB					Very small BLOB				Up to 255 bytes
MEDIUMBLOB					Medium-size BLOB			Up to 16 MB (16,777,215 bytes)
LONGBLOB					Very large BLOB				Up to 4 GB (4,294,967,295 bytes)


â¸»

ðŸ”§ Miscellaneous (Vendor-Specific)

Data Type	Description	Notes
ENUM	String with predefined values	Up to 65,535 elements (MySQL)
SET	Multiple predefined values (MySQL)	Max 64 members
JSON	Stores JSON formatted data	Supported in MySQL & PostgreSQL
UUID	Universally Unique Identifier	16 bytes (128-bit)
XML	XML formatted text (SQL Server)	Variable-length

âœ¨ Tips for Choosing Data Types
	â€¢	âœ… Use the smallest appropriate type for performance.
	â€¢	âœ… Avoid floating-point types for money; use DECIMAL(p,s) instead.
	â€¢	âœ… Always define constraints like NOT NULL, DEFAULT, and CHECK.
