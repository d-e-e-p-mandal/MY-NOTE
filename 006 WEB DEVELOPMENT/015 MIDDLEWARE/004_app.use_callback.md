## Path in Middleware
### 
1️⃣ **Global Middleware (Works for All Routes)**
- Applied using `app.use()`.
- Runs on **every request**, regardless of path.
- Example:
```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("This runs for ALL paths");
    next();
});
```
> Path = /* (all requests)

2️⃣ Route-Specific Middleware
	•	Applied only for a defined path.
	•	Runs when the request matches that path.
	•	Example:

```js
app.use("/admin", (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Middleware only for /admin path");
    next();
});
```
3️⃣ Random/Selected Route Middleware
	•	Applied directly inside a specific route.
	•	Runs only for that one route.
	•	Example:

```js
app.get("/dashboard", (req, res, next) => {
    console.log("Only for /dashboard route");
    next();
}, (req, res) => {
    res.send("Dashboard Page");
});

```
 Path = /dashboard


## 🚨 Error Handling Middleware

### 📌 When does it run?
- If **no route matches** the request (`404`).
- If an **error is thrown** in middleware/route (`500` or custom error).

---

### 1️⃣ **404 Not Found (No Path Executed)**
```js
// Put this after all routes
app.use((req, res) => {
    res.status(404).send("Path Not Found!");
});
