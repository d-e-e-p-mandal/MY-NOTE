useMemo :
.........

1. optimize expensive operation 
    useMemo is used here

2. Referential equality
        In another function when we send props it is an object even same object send it re-render the function component.
    If we want to re-render when props change we use : React.memo

    import React from "react"; // âœ… Needed for React.memo
