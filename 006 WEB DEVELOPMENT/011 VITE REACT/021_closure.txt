Closure : 
    A Closure is features of javaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing)
function variables

* In javaScript, once a function completes its execution, any variables that were defined inside the
function scope cease to exist.

//
function outer() {
    var b = 10;
    function inner(){
        var a = 20;
        console.log(a+b);
    }
    return inner;
}
