 What is an Abstract Class in Java?

An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated (i.e., you can’t create objects from it). It can contain:
	•	Abstract methods (without a body),
	•	Concrete methods (with a body),
	•	Fields (variables), and
	•	Constructors.

⸻

✅ Why use Abstract Classes?
	•	To provide a base class with shared/common behavior.
	•	To force subclasses to implement specific methods.



Syntax :
........

abstract class ClassName {
    // Abstract method (no body)
    abstract void methodName(); //Class must be abstract

    // Concrete method
    void show() {
        System.out.println("This is a concrete method.");
    }
}
