âœ… Basic Java Program Structure

// Class definition
public class Main {

    // Main method: starting point of Java program
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code to execute
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}

ðŸ“˜ Explanation:

Part	Meaning
public class Main	Declares a public class named Main. Filename must be Main.java.
public static void main	Entry point of every Java program. JVM starts execution from here.
String[] args	Command-line arguments (optional).
System.out.println(...)	Used to print output to the console.

ðŸ§  Key Points:
	â€¢	Only one public class per file, and the file name must match it (Main.java).
	â€¢	main() method is required for standalone execution.
	â€¢	Statements end with ;.
	â€¢	Java is case-sensitive.
