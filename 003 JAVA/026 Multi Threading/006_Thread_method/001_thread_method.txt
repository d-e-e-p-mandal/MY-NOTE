Sure! Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of important Thread methods in Java:

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 1. start()
	â€¢	Purpose: Starts a new thread.
	â€¢	How it works: Internally calls run() method on a new call stack (not the current thread).
	â€¢	Note: Never call run() directly; use start() to begin a new thread.

thread.start();


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 2. run()
	â€¢	Purpose: Contains the code that the thread will execute.
	â€¢	How itâ€™s called: Automatically by start(), or manually (but then it runs in main thread).

public void run() {
    System.out.println("Running in thread");
}

ðŸ”¹ 3. sleep(milliseconds)
	â€¢	Purpose: Temporarily pauses the thread.
	â€¢	Throws: InterruptedException, so you must handle with try-catch.

try {
    Thread.sleep(1000); // sleeps for 1 second
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 4. join()
	â€¢	Purpose: Makes the current thread wait until the called thread finishes.

t1.join(); // Main thread waits for t1 to finish


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 5. setName(String name)
	â€¢	Purpose: Sets a custom name for a thread.

thread.setName("WorkerThread");


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 6. getName()
	â€¢	Purpose: Returns the name of the thread.

System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 7. getId()
	â€¢	Purpose: Returns the unique ID of the thread.

System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getId());


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 8. setPriority(int value)
	â€¢	Range: 1 (MIN_PRIORITY) to 10 (MAX_PRIORITY), default is 5.

thread.setPriority(8);


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 9. getPriority()
	â€¢	Purpose: Returns the priority of the thread.

System.out.println(thread.getPriority());


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 10. isAlive()
	â€¢	Purpose: Checks if the thread is still running.

if(thread.isAlive()) {
    System.out.println("Thread is still running");
}


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ 11. interrupt()
	â€¢	Purpose: Interrupts a thread that is sleeping or waiting.

thread.interrupt();
