Hereâ€™s a simple and clear explanation of Operator Precedence and Associativity in Java â€” with examples.

â¸»

âœ… What is Operator Precedence?

Precedence defines which operator is evaluated first in an expression with multiple operators.

Example:

int result = 10 + 5 * 2; 
// Output: 20, because * has higher precedence than +

âœ… What is Associativity?

Associativity decides the direction of execution when two operators have the same precedence.
	â€¢	Left to Right â†’ most operators (like +, -, *, /)
	â€¢	Right to Left â†’ assignment operators (=, +=, etc.), unary operators

ðŸ”¹ Java Operator Precedence Table (High to Low)

Precedence	    Operators	    Associativity	    Description
1 (highest)	    ()	            Left to Right	    Parentheses
2	            ++, --, +, -, !	Right to Left	    Unary operators
3	            *, /, %	        Left to Right	    Multiplicative
4	            +, -	        Left to Right	    Additive
5	            <, >, <=, >=	Left to Right	    Relational
6	            ==, !=	        Left to Right	    Equality
7	            &&	            Left to Right	    Logical AND
8	            `		                            `
9	            ?:	            Right to Left	    Ternary
10	            =, +=, -=, etc.	Right to Left	    Assignment

ðŸ”¸ Examples

ðŸ”¹ 1. Precedence Example

int result = 10 + 5 * 2;
// 5 * 2 = 10 â†’ 10 + 10 = 20

ðŸ”¹ 2. Associativity Example

int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;
int result = a + b + c;
// Left to right: (5 + 10) + 15 = 30

ðŸ”¹ 3. Right-to-Left Associativity

int a, b, c;
a = b = c = 10;
// Same as: a = (b = (c = 10))

âœ… Tip to Remember:
	â€¢	Use parentheses () when youâ€™re not sure of precedence.
	â€¢	Keep expressions clean and readable.
