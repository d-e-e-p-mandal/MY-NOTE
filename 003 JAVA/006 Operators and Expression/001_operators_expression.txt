Hereâ€™s a clear and complete guide to Operators and Expressions in Java â€” including types, examples, and output.

âœ… What are Operators in Java?

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

Example:

int a = 10 + 5;  // + is an operator

ðŸ”¹ Types of Java Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators

Perform basic math operations.

Operator	Meaning	Example
+	Addition	a + b
-	Subtraction	a - b
*	Multiplication	a * b
/	Division	a / b
%	Modulus	a % b

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators

Operator	Meaning	Example
==	Equal to	a == b
!=	Not equal to	a != b
>	Greater than	a > b
<	Less than	a < b
>=	Greater than or equal	a >= b
<=	Less than or equal	a <= b

3. Logical Operators

Operator	Meaning	Example
&&	Logical AND	a > 5 && b < 10
`		`
!	Logical NOT	!(a > 5)


â¸»

4. Assignment Operators

Operator	Meaning	Example
=	Assign value	a = 10
+=	Add and assign	a += 5
-=	Subtract and assign	a -= 3
*=	Multiply and assign	a *= 2
/=	Divide and assign	a /= 4
%=	Modulus and assign	a %= 2


â¸»

5. Unary Operators

Operator	Meaning	Example
+	Unary plus	+a
-	Unary minus	-a
++	Increment	a++ or ++a
--	Decrement	a-- or --a
!	Logical NOT	!true


â¸»

6. Ternary Operator

Used as shorthand for if-else.

int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

7. Bitwise Operators

Operator	Meaning	Example
&	AND	a & b
`	`	OR
^	XOR	a ^ b
~	Complement	~a
<<	Left shift	a << 2
>>	Right shift	a >> 2

âœ… Expressions in Java

An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and values that produces a result.

int result = (a + b) * 2;

ðŸ”¸ Example Java Program

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10, b = 5;

        // Arithmetic
        System.out.println("Add: " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("Sub: " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("Mul: " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("Div: " + (a / b));
        System.out.println("Mod: " + (a % b));

        // Relational
        System.out.println("a > b: " + (a > b));

        // Logical
        System.out.println("a > 0 && b > 0: " + (a > 0 && b > 0));

        // Assignment
        a += 3;  // a = a + 3
        System.out.println("a after += 3: " + a);

        // Ternary
        int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
        System.out.println("Max: " + max);
    }
}
