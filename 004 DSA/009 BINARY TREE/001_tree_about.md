Hereâ€™s a short and clear explanation of the basic Binary Tree concepts and types:

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ Basic Terminologies
	â€¢	Node: A unit in the tree containing a value/data and links to child nodes.
	â€¢	Root: The topmost node in a tree.
	â€¢	Leaf Node: A node with no children (also called external node).
	â€¢	Children: Nodes that are directly connected and below a node.
	â€¢	Parent: A node that has one or more children.
	â€¢	Ancestors: All the nodes on the path from a node to the root.
	â€¢	Height of Tree: The number of edges on the longest path from root to a leaf.
	â€¢	Depth of Node: Number of edges from the root to that node.

ðŸ”¹ Types of Binary Trees
	1.	Full Binary Tree
	â€¢	Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
	â€¢	Example:

    1
   / \
  2   3


	2.	Perfect Binary Tree
	â€¢	All internal nodes have 2 children.
	â€¢	All leaf nodes are at the same level.
	â€¢	Example:

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \ / \
4  5 6  7


	3.	Complete Binary Tree
	â€¢	All levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
	â€¢	Example:

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5


	4.	Balanced Binary Tree
	â€¢	Height difference between left and right subtree of any node is at most 1.
	â€¢	Helps in keeping operations like insert/search efficient (O(log n)).
	5.	Degenerate (or Skewed) Tree
	â€¢	Each node has only one child.
	â€¢	Acts like a linked list.
	â€¢	Example (Right-skewed):

1
 \
  2
   \
    3
